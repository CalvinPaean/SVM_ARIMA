This project is to compare the performance of different models. We have a hybrid model of **SVM and ARIMA, SVM and ARIMA** separately. It aims to show that SVM is good at dealing with non-linear data and ARIMA is better at linear data. Therefore, we assume that the combination of these two models will surpass each of these two individually.
